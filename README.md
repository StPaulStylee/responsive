## What is this Conspicous Sounding Repo?
Responsive is a web template I created prior to attending Prime Digital Academy. I created a page that allowed me to test my metal at HTML, CSS, and media queries.

### Tech
- HTML
- CSS

### responsive is live!
- Lucky you... this page is hosted on Heroku. Go to https://fierce-fortress-51980.herokuapp.com/ to view this beauty! FYI, I am aware that my photo is not correctly loading in the "About" modal. I need to figure that out because when I run the page on a local server it loads correctly. Weird.
